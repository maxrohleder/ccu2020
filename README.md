## Covid Travel Buddy

In these difficult times, travelling has become very strenuous. This is largely due to regulations differing by region and often varying over time. We want to solve this issue by creating a simple web-app, that briefly informs about the circumstances of the destination country. Our key user group will be travellers. That includes but is not limited to business people, tourists and exchange students.
