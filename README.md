## Covid Travel Buddy

In these difficult times, travelling has become very strenuous. This is largely due to regulations differing by region and often varying over time. We want to solve this issue by creating a simple web-app, that briefly informs about the circumstances of the destination country. Our key user group will be travellers. That includes but is not limited to business people, tourists and exchange students.

## Quickstart

See here for prerequisites:
https://angular.io/guide/setup-local

(make sure to invoke all calls to angular and npm in folder /frontend)

After cloning the repository, **install** all dependencies: `npm i`

To **compile** and preview the project, run: `ng serve --open`

To create a **new component** called xyz, run: `ng generate component xyz` or `ng g c xyz`
