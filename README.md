## Covid Travel Buddy

In these difficult times, travelling has become very strenuous. This is largely due to regulations differing by region and often varying over time. We want to solve this issue by creating a simple web-app, that briefly informs about the circumstances of the destination country. Logically, our key user group will be travellers. That includes business travellers, tourists and exchange students.

The very first version of our Application **Covid Travel Buddy** is now released. See the screens below for a quick impression:
